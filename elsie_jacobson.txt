Hi, I'm Elsie Jacobson. I have recently started my PhD at the Liggins Institute, University of Auckland. I am investigating the spatial organisation of DNA in immune cells, and how/if it changes in response to mechanical stress. Generally interested in genomics/bioinformatics as tools to answer cell and molecular biology questions.
