Hi, I'm Elsie. I recently started my PhD at the Liggins Institute, University of Auckland. I'm investigating the spatial organisation of DNA in immune cells, and how/if it changes in response to mechanical stress. Generally interested in using genomics/bioinformatics to answer cell and molecular biology questions.
